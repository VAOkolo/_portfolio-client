Portfolio Website

Responsive Portfolio Website: 

To do:
- sticky footer on about page when navigating carousel
- complete responsive design e.g. having about me carousel containers stack in columns for small screens
- add newer projects to project list and tighten up codebase for featured projects
- add a featured projects panel on the homepage
- complete contact form and contact form functionality

Full credit to @atheermusa for the lovely background fell in love with it and had to use it for my portfolio. Love the solution you used to create the visual effect.
